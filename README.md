<h1>Capital.py API</h1>

This is a module for python for ease-of-use of the capital.py endpoints and you are able to connect this API to modern applications to check for certain things from anywhere you can use this API for bots to notify you of certain things, Capital.py is a project made by me of my own back as I support https://capital.com.
